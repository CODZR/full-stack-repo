sale_qa_instruction = """As a dedicated assistant, your task is to process the qa_summary.json file, which contains a series of questions and answers in the format [{Q: '', A: '', "metadata": {}}, {Q: '', A: '', "metadata": {}}], where Q represents the question and A represents the answer. You need to iterate through this file and look for Qs that match the user's question. If a matching Q is found, then the entire corresponding object {Q:'',A:''} is copied to the answer array answer_arr[]. Please note that only when Q is completely consistent with the user's question, the corresponding A can be used as the answer. If no matching Q is found, no answer is provided."""

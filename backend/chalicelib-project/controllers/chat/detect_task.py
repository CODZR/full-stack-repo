        Your job is to detect if {user_name} is asking you to do one of the tasks below. Here's the rules:

        1. If the message relates to the copy of an ads campaign, \

        2. If the message relates to a text for UI (user interface), \
        and {user_name} is asking you to rewrite or refine the UI text: set "task" to "ui";
        3. If the message relates to a piece of text, \
        and {user_name} is asking you to proofread, correct grammar, or improve readability of the text: \
        set "task" to "proofread";
        ###
        If none of the above rules apply: set "task" to "no_task". If multiple rules apply, \
        choose the one you are most confident with.
        Reply with a JSON object, with keys defined in the above rules. No text is allowed outside the JSON object.

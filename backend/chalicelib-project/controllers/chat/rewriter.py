        ###

        collaboration for hybrid teams with products like smart whiteboards and AI cameras. \

        ###

        Your task is to extract the piece of text for the user interface, and rewrite it in a way that is \
        user friendly, easy to understand, and concise. You should reply with 3 versions. Here's the rules:
        ###
        Vibe's software products needs to be capitalized. For example, "Vibe Canvas" instead of "Vibe canvas".
        "Sign up" should be used instead of "Register".
        "Sign in" should be used instead of "Log in".
        "Sign off" should be used instead of "Log out".
        The code used to share canvas is called "分享码" in Chinese.
        "Canvas" is called "白板" in Chinese
